                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Nova Tolmoff! I'm 20 years old, and I am currently a junior in college at Michigan State University majoring in Games and Interactive Media. My hobbies are playing video games and listening to music. In fact, video games have been a huge part of my life for about as long as I can remember. My dad moved around a lot as part of the Air Force, so video games were a good source of stability in my life, as well as a good way to stay connected to old friends. As I got older, I became more and more enamored with the concepts of game and level design, and all the other qualities that made my favorite games great.

                <h2>My Programming Work</h2>

                <p>
                    As I was initially majoring in computer science when I enrolled in college, I have naturally had a lot of experience in coding in various languages. In recent years, I have mostly used C#, but have done work in C++, Java, and Python. While I have yet to code for an entire game from scratch, I have done a lot of smaller pieces by themselves, such as making a custom powerup and modifying a procedural generator to make randomized urban-styled buildings, as pictured here.

                <h2>My Art Experience</h2>

                <p>
                    I've been doing art for even longer, originally starting as a hobby in middle school. I started out in traditional pencil and paper, because that's what I had when I was 13, but eventually I acquired a drawing tablet and began doing digital art. While I still have a long way to go with this aspect of my line of work, I have also come a very long way since starting. I have also done a decent amount of 3D modeling, mostly in Blender, an example of which can be seen in the section above, wherein I modeled all the pieces of the buildings myself. Lately, I have started branching out and trying my hand at pixel art and character design, a combination of which is pictured here.
